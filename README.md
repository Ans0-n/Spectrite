# Spectrite Mod

## Description
This is a Minecraft Forge mod that adds a new and extremely rare mineral to world generation in all 3 default dimensions. Hold on! This isn't just another boring mineral mod! This mineral is capable of crafting far better items than diamond such as a pickaxe that can mine 9 blocks at once and an armour set that, with all the pieces, will make you practically invincible. Sound game-breaking? Not really, spectrite is really hard to come by so it would usually take a very long time to acquire enough to craft items with it, unless of course you decide to make it more common in the configuration. This mod, aside from providing the (hard-to-reach) means of making you extremely overpowered, fits right into Vanilla gameplay, so I can recommend using it no matter what mods you use. To be honest, I (the developer) can't even play the game without it anymore.

## Finding Spectrite Ore
Spectrite Ore is intended to be very rare, even though it is the only ore you can find it in any of the 3 dimensions. Unlike other ores, the size of a vein is chosen by taking a random number between the minimum and maximum vein sizes, taking another random number between 1 and the first random number, and repeating this a third time. This means that there is a very high chance of getting a vein with the minimum size and a very low chance of getting a vein with the maximum size. The chances a Spectrite Ore vein generating, by default, are different for each dimension:

### The Surface
There is only 1 chance of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=1 and height=16 with a maximum vein size of 4 and a minimum vein size of 1. While you can find Spectrite Ore in this dimension, due to the large amount of lava between these height coordinates, it is not recommend you spend too much time looking for it here, especially if you have access to other dimensions.

### The Nether
There are 2 chances of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=1 and height=127 with a maximum vein size of 6 and a minimum vein size of 1. As long as you don't have a shader on, such as SEUS, that reduces the visibility of this dimension with poor lighting, it is significantly easier to find Spectrite Ore here as long as you don't mind travelling large distances in this dimension.

### The End
There are 2 chances of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=4 and height=55 with a maximum vein size of 10 and a minimum vein size of 10. This is actually not all that rare due to the visibility of the sides of the floating land masses in this dimension, so while Spectrite Boss mobs (which will be discussed further on) cannot be found in The End (no humanoid entities exist in The End), this is definitely the best place, with default configuration settings, to obtain Spectrite for crafting.

## Blocks and Items

### Mineral Chests (Iron, Gold, Diamond, and Spectrite)
A chest with the texture of a mineral. You may smelt them for 5 of their mineral's respective crafting material, though it takes 8 to craft a chest, so it's inefficient to do this unless you desparately need some of the mineral you crafted the chest with. Unfortunately, the textures for these chests are not resource pack compatible so they will have textures like mineral blocks regardless of the resource pack being used. These chests serve no special purpose, they are purely for bragging rights. ("Look at me, I have so many diamonds I can afford to make a chest out of diamond blocks!")

### Spectrite Gem
An extremely rare mineral that can be acquired by mining Spectrite Ore.

### Diamond Rod
A stick of diamond that is used in crafting as a diamond handle for Spectrite tools. It is crafted the same as a wooden stick, but with diamonds.

### Spectrite Shovel
An extremely efficient shovel made of Spectrite with a diamond handle. When used on a shovel-effective block, a cross of surrounding weaker or equivalent blocks will also be destroyed, resulting in a maximum of 5 blocks destroyed per use. The surrounding blocks that will be destroyed depend on the player's rotation and perspective. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for destroying 5 shovel-effective blocks and only one block will be destroyed if the shovel is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

### Perfect Spectrite Shovel
A ridiculously efficient shovel made entirely of Spectrite. When used on a shovel-effective block, a square of surrounding weaker or equivalent blocks will also be destroyed, resulting in a maximum of 9 blocks destroyed per use. The surrounding blocks that will be destroyed depend on the player's rotation and perspective. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for destroying 9 shovel-effective blocks and only one block will be destroyed if the shovel is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

### Spectrite Sword
A powerful sword made of Spectrite with a diamond handle. It not only has a high attack, but inflicts an instant damage effect on its target. It also inflicts instant damage on enemy entities adjacent to the target but has no affect on blocks nor allies. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with instant damage and no instant damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

### Perfect Spectrite Sword
A ridiculously powerful sword made entirely of Spectrite. This sword creates a small explosion when used on an entity and inflicts more damage than the diamond handle version. Neither allies nor blocks are affected by this explosion. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with instant damage and no instant damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

### Spectrite Legend Blade
A special sword capable of even higher damage than a Perfect Spectrite Sword and also creates a larger explosion. This sword cannot be crafted and can only be obtained by defeating a Spectrite Boss mob that uses this sword. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with instant damage and no instant damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

### Perfect Spectrite Legend Blade
A special sword capable of insane damage that will always 1-shot most non-boss entities. It creates a huge explosion. This sword cannot be crafted and can only be obtained by defeating a Spectrite Boss mob that uses this sword. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with instant damage and no instant damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

### Spectrite Armour (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots)
A set of armour made of spectrite. It's just as protective as diamond but lasts a lot longer. In addition, for every piece of armour equipped, the player will be provided with 1 level of Absorption (2 hearts) until the last armour piece which will provide Regeneration I instead. The effects last 10 seconds but reapply as long as the player is still wearing the required armour. Also, Absorption is applied 1 level at a time and is only applied if the player's health is full.

### Spectrite Healing Orb
A prismatic orb filled with healing power that, when used with a right click, will give you 15 seconds of regeneration with a 30 second cooldown (15 seconds between regeneration). If used with full Spectrite Armour, it will enhance your already present regeneration effect. This cannot be crafted and can only be acquired by defeating a Spectrite Boss mob that is holding this orb.

## Spectrite Bosses
With this mod, on rare occassions, a Zombie or Skeleton, marked with a hue-rotating crown icon above its head, may spawn with full Spectrite Armour and a Spectrite Legend Blade or sometimes even a Perfect Spectrite Legend Blade. They also hold a Spectrite Healing Orb which will make them hard (maybe impossible) to kill unless you have a regular Spectrite Sword at the very least. It is recommended that you stay away from these guys until you have Spectrite Armour because otherwise they are almost guaranteed to 1-hit you, unless they are holding a Perfect Spectrite Legend Blade, in which case they will probably 1-hit you either way. In any case, if you have keep inventory off, make a spawn point nearby so you can pick up your lost items if you die. Armour pieces will drop at a default rate of 25% each and the sword and orb will drop at a 50% default rate. These odds along with the rate of Spectrite Bosses can be adjusted in the config, but it is recommended you don't make them much higher than they are by default to avoid making it too easy to get Spectrite Armour and Legend Blades. The intention was that your primary means of acquiring Spectrite Ore would be through mining and, if you were lucky enough to come across one, you might eventually find a Spectrite Boss and, if you don't get yourself killed, might get a Spectrite Legend Blade and/or Healing Orb along with some armour pieces.

## Known Bugs

* Changing difficulty to peaceful while a Spectrite Boss' boss bar is showing will make the bar stay on the screen until either the player dies or goes back to the menu
* The name of the Spectrite Legend Sword and Perfect Spectrite Legend Sword cannot be changed; this is because the text formatting in the default name would cause of mess of formatting characters translated into text, so this is an intential bug added to prevent a worse bug
* Changing dimensions with a Spectrite Armour max health boost may not appear to carry over into other dimensions and may cause buggy behaviour when taking damage (this is a Vanilla bug)
