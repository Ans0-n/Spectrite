# Spectrite Mod

## Description
This is a Minecraft Forge mod that adds a new and extremely rare mineral to world generation in all 3 default dimensions. Hold on! This isn't just another boring mineral mod! This mineral is capable of crafting far better items than diamond such as a pickaxe that can mine 9 blocks at once and an armour set that, with all the pieces, will make you practically invincible. Spectrite items and mobs are far superior to their vanilla counterparts but, since you'll hardly ever encounter them, they generally won't throw off the balance of the game too much. If you find that they do, you can always adjust the configurations to suit your preferences.

## Finding Spectrite Ore
Spectrite Ore is intended to be very rare, even though it is the only ore you can find it in any of the 3 dimensions. Unlike other ores, the size of a vein is chosen by taking a random number between the minimum and maximum vein sizes, taking another random number between 1 and the first random number, and repeating this a third time. This means that there is a very high chance of getting a vein with the minimum size and a very low chance of getting a vein with the maximum size. The chances of a Spectrite Ore vein generating, by default, are different for each dimension:

### The Overworld
There is only 1 chance of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=1 and height=16 with a maximum vein size of 4 and a minimum vein size of 1. While you can find Spectrite Ore in this dimension, due to the large amount of lava between these height coordinates, it is not recommend you spend too much time looking for it here, especially if you have access to other dimensions.

### The Nether
There is 1 chance of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=1 and height=127 with a maximum vein size of 5 and a minimum vein size of 1. As long as you don't have a shader on, such as SEUS, that reduces the visibility of this dimension with poor lighting, it is significantly easier to find Spectrite Ore here due to the openness of the dimension, especially if you are playing with a high resolution.

### The End
There are 2 chances of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=4 and height=55 with a maximum vein size of 8 and a minimum vein size of 10. This is actually not all that rare due to the visibility of the sides of the floating land masses in this dimension. With the exception of the Spectrite Dungeon, this is definitely the best place, with default configuration settings, to obtain Spectrite for crafting.

## Spectrite Dungeons
In every world, one Spectrite Dungeon will spawn somewhere, almost always a long journey from the spawn point. It can, however, be tracked down by crafting a Spectrite Compass and following it. The structure of the dungeon is fairly simple, though it should only be entered through its entrance on the surface as every other part of it is surrounded by Molten Spectrite which is much hotter than lava and will likely kill you on contact. This is also a good reason you probably shouldn't break any walls, though there are certain walls with paths on the other side, but none of these paths are exclusively accessed by breaking walls. This dungeon is also, by far, the easiest way to get Spectrite materials and items. The only catch is that it's full of Spectrite mobs. These include Spectrite Skeletons, Spectrite Wither Skeletons, Spectrite Creepers, and Spectrite Golems. These mobs have more health than their regular counterparts, have passive Spectrite Resistance, and will attack with Spectrite Damage which does damage equivalent to an Instant Damage effect of the same level. Spectrite Golems in particular will hit so hard that you need Spectrite Armour to even survive a single hit. Thankfully, unlike the other mobs, they aren't aggressive as long as you don't bump into them, though avoiding them could prove difficult if they are blocking your escape route. There are 3 floors to each dungeon with better loot with every floor. At the very end is a portal that lets you teleport back to the entrance so you don't have to worry about losing all that valuable loot you've collected.

## Spectrite Skull Structures
On occasion, a large skull-shaped building made of Spectrite Bone blocks and Spectrite Bricks will spawn, either in the Overworld or the Nether. In the Overworld, they will, by default, usually generate near bedrock level, but they may on rare occasion generate on the surface. In the Nether, they tend to generate at the lowest level that has an accessible space. These structures contain 5 mob spawners: 2 Spectrite Skeleton spawners, 2 Spectrite Wither Skeleton spawners, and 1 Spectrite Blaze spawner. With these mobs, it is quite difficult to get through this small structure on any difficulty, though at the end there is a chest with a loot table of either the mid-tier chest in the Spectrite Dungeon or, sometimes, a high-tier chest. Depending on configuration, this chest may be a Spectrite Chest.

## Blocks and Items

### Spectrite Chest
A chest with the texture of Spectrite. You may smelt it for 5 Spectrite Blocks, though it takes 8 to craft a chest (plus a diamond), so it's inefficient to do this unless you desperately need some of the Spectrite Blocks you crafted the chest with. These chests serve no purpose in version 1.2.0 and below but, as of 1.3.0, every 200 ticks, there is a random chance (0.5% by default) that a random slot will be selected in the chest and, if the slot contains a Spectrite item that has a multicoloured name, it will be enchanted with Superchromaticity which will enhance the item based on its type.

### Spectrite Star
The star dropped from a defeated Spectrite Wither. It can be used to create Invulnerable Spectrite Wither parts or can be crafted into 5 Nether Stars.

### Diamond Spectrite Shovel
An extremely efficient shovel made of Spectrite with a diamond handle. When used on a shovel-effective block, a cross of surrounding weaker or equivalent blocks will also be destroyed, resulting in a maximum of 5 blocks destroyed per use. The surrounding blocks that will be destroyed depend on the player's rotation and perspective. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for destroying 5 shovel-effective blocks and only one block will be destroyed if the shovel is used before this cooldown has finished. If used to attack an entity, it will inflict Spectrite Damage I with a longer cooldown (default 3.5s).

### Diamond Spectrite Arrow
An arrow made of Spectrite with a diamond shaft. On collision, they will inflict dispersed Spectrite Damage II. The collision effect can also be configured to be replaced with an ordinary explosion (damages terrain and self/allies), or to keep the Spectrite Damage effect while also adding an explosion. These arrows are very expensive to craft, therefore it is recommended they only be used with Spectrite Bows with the infinity enchantment. These arrows can be fired from an ordinary bow, but they will do heavy damage to the bow. Spectrite Bows and Diamond Spectrite Bows are able to fire these arrows while taking significantly less damage.

### Spectrite Armour (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots)
A set of armour made of spectrite. It's just as protective as diamond but lasts a lot longer. In addition, the player's max health is increased with every piece with more health given for pieces that require more Spectrite Gems to craft. The total max health increase, without Superchromaticity, is 10 hearts by default but, depending on the value of the 'Spectrite Armour Bonus Mode' configuration option, this could also be halved to 5 hearts or doubled to 20 hearts (Superchromaticity is always double). Using a Spectrite Anvil, certain passive Spectrite Orb effects can be added to each armour piece.

Superchromaticity Effect: Health increase is doubled
Set Bonus: Passive Spectrite Resistance I
Superchromaticity Set Bonus: Passive Spectrite Resistance II

### Spectrite Orb
A mysterious orb known to be held by Spectrite Endermen. It provides one or more passive potion effects with level 1 but, when activated, a level 2 effect is activated for a limited duration (default 15s) with a cooldown (default 90s). During this cooldown, the passive effect will not be provided. Orbs can be combined in any combination using a Spectrite Anvil, though it becomes more expensive with every orb added. Orbs can also be fused with Spectrite Armour to provide passive effects when wearing the armour, though this is also expensive. Each orb effect has a specific armour type it can be applied to.

Berserk (red) - Chestplate
Lightweight (orange) - Boots
Prosperity (yellow) - Helmet
Agility (green) - Leggings
Amphibious (blue) - Helmet
Endurance (indigo) - Chestplate
Resilience (violet) - Helmet

### Perfect Spectrite Orb
The result of combining all 7 Spectrite Orbs together. It works the same way as a regular Spectrite Orb, but provides Spectrite Power in addition to the other 7 effects. If an imperfect Spectrite Orb is combined with Spectrite Orb fused Spectrite Armour to provide all 7 effects, Spectrite Power will also be provided.

### Spectrite Crystal
An Ender Crystal made with Spectrite Glass. Like a regular Ender Crystal, it may only be placed in bedrock or obsidian. Any mob that spawns in close proximity to a placed Spectrite Crystal (default 32 block radius) has a significantly higher chance of spawning as a Spectrite mob (default 0.1% -> 1%). As you might expect, the explosion that results from breaking one of these is much more intense than that of a regular Ender Crystal and you probably don't want to be nearby if one does explode.

### Bucket of Molten Spectrite
A bucket of deadly Molten Spectrite. Its only practical use is as a last-resort weapon since it cannot be used as a fuel source since it would melt its container. What? You want to know how the bucket can hold it? Well that's obviously becau

## Mobs

### Spectrite Creeper
A creeper made of Spectrite. It has 2.5x the health of a regular creeper and its explosion inflicts a massive Spectrite Damage effect that leaves behind a lingering cloud of Spectrite Damage. They also drop Spectrite Dust which can be used to brew Spectrite Power potions.

### Spectrite Skeleton
A skeleton made of Spectrite.It has 2.5x the health of a regular skeleton, but it also receives the same health bonuses as a player does from Spectrite Armour. It carries either a Diamond Spectrite Bow with Diamond Spectrite Arrows or Spectrite Bow with Spectrite Arrows. Upon being defeated, it may drop a single Spectrite Arrow of the same type as the one it holds. It also has a chance to have a Spectrite Sword instead of a bow and arrows. Its armour and weapon each have a very small chance of dropping. The bones it drops can be used to brew Spectrite Resistance potions.

### Spectrite Wither Skeleton
A wither skeleton made of Spectrite. It has 2.5x the health of a regular skeleton, but it also receives the same health bonuses as a player does from Spectrite Armour. It carries a Diamond Spectrite Sword, a Spectrite Sword or, on a very rare occasion, a Spectrite Legend Blade. It also has a chance to have a Spectrite Bow and arrows instead of a sword. Upon being defeated, its armour and weapon each have a very small chance of dropping. It also may drop its skull which can be used as a decent helmet. The bones it drops can be used to brew Spectrite Resistance potions.

### Spectrite Golem
A golem made of Spectrite that lives in Spectrite Dungeons. It has 2.5x the health of an iron golem. They are usually quite peaceful, though they do not like to be pushed around. They have extremely high endurance and inflict massive Spectrite Damage, but are somewhat lacking when it comes to speed. They will naturally heal over time. The bricks it drops can be used to brew Spectrite Damage potions.

Spectrite Golems have unique drops: Spectrite Brick (common), Spectrite Gem (uncommon), Diamond Spectrite Shield (very rare), Spectrite Shield (extremely rare)

Friendly Spectrite Golems can also be summoned by the player using the same pattern as the Iron Golem, but with Spectrite Blocks instead of Iron Blocks.

### Spectrite Blaze
A blaze made of Spectrite. It has 2.5x the health of a regular blaze and its fireballs inflict heavy Spectrite Damage. This is twice as powerful as a Spectrite Arrow fired from a Spectrite Skeleton. They drop Spectrite Blaze Rods which can be used to craft Spectrite Blaze Powder, an ingredient for Spectrite Potions.

### Spectrite Enderman
An enderman made of Spectrite. It has 2.5x the health of a regular enderman and it inflicts massive Spectrite Damage. In place of a pumpkin, any Spectrite mob skull will prevent them from attacking when looked at. It will avoid any damage less than 5 hearts by teleporting. With the already high rarity of endermen, Spectrite Endermen are exceedingly rare. The best chance of finding one is in The End or in the Spectrite Dungeon. Upon being defeated, it will drop a random Spectrite Orb with one effect.

### Spectrite Wither
A wither made of Spectrite. It has 2.5x the health of a regular wither and its skulls are much more powerful, adding Spectrite Damage and, if invulnerable, lingering clouds of Spectrite Damage. If on normal difficulty or higher, it will occassionally use a special attack where it rises and spins, firing skulls diagonally downward in all directions. After enough damage on hard mode, it will do 3 fast spins instead of 1 slow one. Upon being defeated, he drops a Spectrite Star, a Spectrite Wither Skull, a Spectrite Wither Torso, and a Spectrite Wither Tail.

## Enchantments

### Superchromaticity
An enchantment that only works on tools and weapons made entirely out of Spectrite. These items will always have a multicoloured name. The enchantment will have a different effect based on the type of item, but this effect is always be a significant enhancement. The most common effect is to cut the item's cooldown in half. These compatible items can be enchanted either by a Spectrite Chest or by using an enchantment book found in a Spectrite Dungeon.

## Potion Effects

### Spectrite Resistance
Lowers the level of Spectrite Damage received level for level.

### Spectrite Power
Increases the level of Spectrite Damage inflicted level for level. When all Spectrite Orb effects are present, this effect will be applied.

### Spectrite Damage
Applies special magic damage though, unlike other types of magic damage, it can be reduced with armour. It is often inflicted with dispersed damage, doing one less level of damage for every block of distance. The maximum level possible without commands is 6. It inflicts high to shields with an exponential increase with every level.

Damage is calculated with the following formula: (2 * level) + (2 ^ level) + 0.5

This translates into the following damage amounts for each level:

I - 4.5
II - 8.5
III - 14.5
IV - 24.5
V - 42.5
VI - 76.5

A Spectrite Orb effect. It adds 50% of the original damage to attack damage for every level and increases knockback.

### Lightweight

### Prosperity

## Known Bugs

* Changing dimensions with a Spectrite Armour max health boost may not appear to carry over into other dimensions and may cause buggy behaviour when taking damage (this is a Vanilla bug)
* Chests in Spectrite Skull structures that load during initial generation will always be Spectrite Chests regardless of configuration; the reason for the replacement not working during initial generation is unclear
