# Spectrite Mod

## Description
This is a Minecraft Forge mod that adds a new and extremely rare mineral to world generation in all 3 default dimensions. Hold on! This isn't just another boring mineral mod! This mineral is capable of crafting far better items than diamond such as a pickaxe that can mine 9 blocks at once and an armour set that, with all the pieces, will make you practically invincible. Sound game-breaking? Not really, Spectrite is really hard to come by so it would usually take a very long time to acquire enough to craft items with it, unless of course you decide to make it more common in the configuration. This mod, aside from providing the (hard-to-reach) means of making you extremely overpowered, fits right into Vanilla gameplay, so I can recommend using it no matter what mods you use. To be honest, I (the developer) can't even play the game without it anymore.

## Finding Spectrite Ore
Spectrite Ore is intended to be very rare, even though it is the only ore you can find it in any of the 3 dimensions. Unlike other ores, the size of a vein is chosen by taking a random number between the minimum and maximum vein sizes, taking another random number between 1 and the first random number, and repeating this a third time. This means that there is a very high chance of getting a vein with the minimum size and a very low chance of getting a vein with the maximum size. The chances a Spectrite Ore vein generating, by default, are different for each dimension:

### The Surface
There is only 1 chance of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=1 and height=16 with a maximum vein size of 4 and a minimum vein size of 1. While you can find Spectrite Ore in this dimension, due to the large amount of lava between these height coordinates, it is not recommend you spend too much time looking for it here, especially if you have access to other dimensions.

### The Nether
There are 2 chances of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=1 and height=127 with a maximum vein size of 6 and a minimum vein size of 1. As long as you don't have a shader on, such as SEUS, that reduces the visibility of this dimension with poor lighting, it is significantly easier to find Spectrite Ore here as long as you don't mind travelling large distances in this dimension.

### The End
There are 2 chances of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=4 and height=55 with a maximum vein size of 10 and a minimum vein size of 10. This is actually not all that rare due to the visibility of the sides of the floating land masses in this dimension, so while Spectrite Boss mobs (which will be discussed further on) cannot be found in The End (no humanoid entities exist in The End), this is definitely the best place, with default configuration settings, to obtain Spectrite for crafting.

## Blocks and Items

### Spectrite Chest
A chest with the texture of Spectrite. You may smelt it for 5 Spectrite Gems, though it takes 8 to craft a chest (plus a diamond), so it's inefficient to do this unless you desperately need some of the Spectrite Gems you crafted the chest with. These chests serve no special purpose, they are purely for bragging rights. ("Look at me, I have so much Spectrite I can afford to make a chest out of Spectrite Blocks!")

### Spectrite Ore
An extremely rare ore that can be found in the same place as diamonds in the surface world, though significantly rarer, but can also be found more commonly in the Nether and The End. 

### Spectrite Gem
An extremely rare mineral that can be acquired by mining Spectrite Ore.

### Diamond Rod

### Spectrite Shovel
An extremely efficient shovel made of Spectrite with a diamond handle. When used on a shovel-effective block, a cross of surrounding weaker or equivalent blocks will also be destroyed, resulting in a maximum of 5 blocks destroyed per use. The surrounding blocks that will be destroyed depend on the player's rotation and perspective. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for destroying 5 shovel-effective blocks and only one block will be destroyed if the shovel is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

When used on a shovel-effective block, a square of surrounding weaker or equivalent blocks will also be destroyed, resulting in a maximum of 9 blocks destroyed per use. The surrounding blocks that will be destroyed depend on the player's rotation and perspective. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for destroying 9 shovel-effective blocks and only one block will be destroyed if the shovel is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

### Spectrite Sword
A powerful sword made of Spectrite with a diamond handle. It not only has a high attack, but inflicts an instant damage effect on its target. It also inflicts instant damage on enemy entities adjacent to the target but has no affect on blocks nor allies. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with instant damage and no instant damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end. The instant damage effect will also be substituted for instant health for undead entities, deal higher than normal damage to non-Spectrite shields, and inflict high damage to bosses of 200 HP or more.

### Perfect Spectrite Sword
A ridiculously powerful sword made entirely of Spectrite. This sword creates a small explosion when used on an entity and inflicts more damage than the diamond handle version. Neither allies nor blocks are affected by this explosion. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with instant damage and no instant damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end. The instant damage effect will also be substituted for instant health for undead entities, deal high damage to non-Spectrite shields, and inflict heavy damage to bosses of 200 HP or more.

### Spectrite Legend Blade
A special sword capable of even higher damage than a Perfect Spectrite Sword and also creates a larger explosion. This sword cannot be crafted and can only be obtained by defeating a Spectrite Boss mob that uses this sword. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with instant damage and no instant damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end. The instant damage effect will also be substituted for instant health for undead entities, deal high damage to non-Spectrite shields, and inflict massive damage to bosses of 200 HP or more.

### Perfect Spectrite Legend Blade
A special sword capable of insane damage that will always 1-shot most non-boss entities. It creates a huge explosion. This sword cannot be crafted and can only be obtained by defeating a Spectrite Boss mob that uses this sword. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with instant damage and no instant damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end. The instant damage effect will also be substituted for instant health for undead entities, deal heavy damage to non-Spectrite shields, and inflict insane damage to bosses of 200 HP or more.

### Spectrite Arrow
A bow made of Spectrite. On collision, they explode with a similar Instant Damage effect to a Perfect Spectrite Sword, or a Spectrite Legend Sword effect for critical arrows. This effect can also be configured to be replaced with an ordinary explosion (damages terrain and self/allies), or to keep the Instant Damage effect while also adding an explosion. These arrows are extremely expensive to craft, therefore it is recommended they only be used with Spectrite bows with the infinity enchantment. These arrows can be fired from an ordinary bow, but they will do heavy damage to it and a fully repaired bow without unbreaking will be destroyed after just 4 Spectrite Arrows. Spectrite Bows are able to fire these arrows while taking significantly less damage.

### Spectrite Armour (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots)
A set of armour made of spectrite. It's just as protective as diamond but lasts a lot longer. In addition, the player's max health is increased with every piece with more health given for pieces that require more Spectrite Gems. The total max health increase is 10 hearts by default but, depending on the value of the 'Spectrite Armour Bonus Mode' configuration option, the increase could be up to 50 hearts, though this setting is not recommended. There is also a set bonus provided when the player has equipped all pieces, which is by default a passive Regeneration I effect.

### Spectrite Healing Orb
A prismatic orb filled with healing power that, when used with a right click, will give you 15 seconds of regeneration with a 30 second cooldown (15 seconds between regeneration). If used with full Spectrite Armour, it will enhance your already present regeneration effect. This cannot be crafted and can only be acquired by defeating a Spectrite Boss mob that is holding this orb.

## Spectrite Bosses
With this mod, on rare occassions, a Zombie, Skeleton, or Zombie Pigman, marked with a hue-rotating crown icon above its head, may spawn with full Spectrite Armour and a Spectrite Weapon. Skeletons may spawn with a Spectrite Bow or Perfect Spectrite Bow and 1-4 Spectrite Arrows in their secondary hand while all other mobs will spawn with a sword ranging from a Spectrite Sword to a Perfect Spectrite Legend Blade and a Spectrite Healing Orb which will make them hard (maybe impossible) to kill unless you have a regular Spectrite Sword at the very least (unless you're on hard mode, then you'll definitely need a perfect one). It is recommended that you stay away from these guys until you have Spectrite Armour because otherwise they are almost guaranteed to 1-hit you, unless they are holding a Perfect Spectrite Legend Blade, in which case they will probably 1-hit you either way. In any case, if you have keep inventory off, make a spawn point nearby so you can pick up your lost items if you die. Armour pieces will drop at a default rate of 25% each and the weapon and orb will drop at a 50% default rate. Skeletons will drop 1-4 arrows at a 100% rate by default. These odds along with the rate of Spectrite Bosses can be adjusted in the config, but it is recommended you don't make them much higher than they are by default to avoid making it too easy to get Spectrite Armour and Legend Blades. The intention was that your primary means of acquiring Spectrite Ore would be through mining and, if you were lucky enough to come across one, you might eventually find a Spectrite Boss and, if you don't get yourself killed, might get a Spectrite Legend Blade and/or Healing Orb along with some armour pieces.

## Known Bugs

* Changing difficulty to peaceful while a Spectrite Boss' boss bar is showing will make the bar stay on the screen until either the player dies or goes back to the menu
* The name of the Spectrite Legend Sword and Perfect Spectrite Legend Sword cannot be changed; this is because the text formatting in the default name would cause of mess of formatting characters translated into text, so this is an intential bug added to prevent a worse bug
* Changing dimensions with a Spectrite Armour max health boost may not appear to carry over into other dimensions and may cause buggy behaviour when taking damage (this is a Vanilla bug)
* Skeleton Spectrite Bosses may temporarily think their Spectrite Bow is a melee weapon, but this will fix itself shortly after
