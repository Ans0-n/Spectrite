# Spectrite Mod

## Description
This is a Minecraft Forge mod that adds a new and extremely rare mineral to world generation in all 3 default dimensions. Hold on! This isn't just another boring mineral mod! This mineral is capable of crafting far better items than diamond such as a pickaxe that can mine 9 blocks at once and an armour set that, with all the pieces, will make you practically invincible. Sound game-breaking? Not really, Spectrite is really hard to come by so it would usually take a very long time to acquire enough to craft items with it, unless of course you decide to make it more common in the configuration. This mod, aside from providing the (hard-to-reach) means of making you extremely overpowered, fits right into Vanilla gameplay, so I can recommend using it no matter what mods you use. To be honest, I (the developer) can't even play the game without it anymore.

## Finding Spectrite Ore
Spectrite Ore is intended to be very rare, even though it is the only ore you can find it in any of the 3 dimensions. Unlike other ores, the size of a vein is chosen by taking a random number between the minimum and maximum vein sizes, taking another random number between 1 and the first random number, and repeating this a third time. This means that there is a very high chance of getting a vein with the minimum size and a very low chance of getting a vein with the maximum size. The chances of a Spectrite Ore vein generating, by default, are different for each dimension:

### The Surface
There is only 1 chance of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=1 and height=16 with a maximum vein size of 4 and a minimum vein size of 1. While you can find Spectrite Ore in this dimension, due to the large amount of lava between these height coordinates, it is not recommend you spend too much time looking for it here, especially if you have access to other dimensions.

### The Nether
There is 1 chance of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=1 and height=127 with a maximum vein size of 5 and a minimum vein size of 1. As long as you don't have a shader on, such as SEUS, that reduces the visibility of this dimension with poor lighting, it is significantly easier to find Spectrite Ore here due to the openness of the dimension, especially if you are playing with a high resolution.

### The End
There are 2 chances of a Spectrite Ore vein per chunk between height=4 and height=55 with a maximum vein size of 8 and a minimum vein size of 10. This is actually not all that rare due to the visibility of the sides of the floating land masses in this dimension. With the exception of the Spectrite Dungeon, this is definitely the best place, with default configuration settings, to obtain Spectrite for crafting.

## Spectrite Dungeons
In every world, one Spectrite Dungeon will spawn somewhere, almost always a long journey from the spawn point. It can, however, be tracked down by crafting a Spectrite Compass and following it. The structure of the dungeon is fairly simple, though it should only be entered through its entrance on the surface as every other part of it is surrounded by Molten Spectrite which is much hotter than lava and will likely kill you on contact. This is also a good reason you probably shouldn't break any walls, though there are certain walls with paths on the other side, but none of these paths are exclusively accessed by breaking walls. This dungeon is also, by far, the easiest way to get Spectrite materials and items. The only catch is that it's full of Spectrite mobs. These include Spectrite Skeletons, Spectrite Wither Skeletons, Spectrite Creepers, and Spectrite Golems. These mobs have more health than their regular counterparts, have passive Spectrite Resistance, and will attack with Spectrite Damage which does damage equivalent to an Instant Damage effect of the same level. Spectrite Golems in particular will hit so hard that you need Spectrite Armour to even survive a single hit. Thankfully, unlike the other mobs, they aren't aggressive as long as you don't bump into them, though avoiding them could prove difficult if they are blocking your escape route. There are 3 floors to each dungeon with better loot with every floor. At the very end is a portal that lets you teleport back to the entrance so you don't have to worry about losing all that valuable loot you've collected.

## Blocks and Items

### Spectrite Chest
A chest with the texture of Spectrite. You may smelt it for 5 Spectrite Blocks, though it takes 8 to craft a chest (plus a diamond), so it's inefficient to do this unless you desperately need some of the Spectrite Blocks you crafted the chest with. These chests serve no purpose in version 1.2.0 and below but, as of 1.3.0, every 200 ticks, there is a random chance (0.5% by default) that a random slot will be selected in the chest and, if the slot contains a Spectrite item that has a multicoloured name, it will be enchanted with Superchromaticity which will enhance the item based on its type.

An extremely rare ore that can be found in the same place as diamonds in the surface world, though significantly rarer, but can also be found more commonly in the Nether and The End. 

### Spectrite Block
A block of pure Spectrite. It can function as a beacon base. It is also used as a component for summoning Spectrite Golems, much like the Iron Golem pattern but with Spectrite Blocks instead of Iron Blocks.

Essentially lava but with Spectrite instead of rock. Though, it's much hotter than lava and no potion could protect you against the intense heat of this element.

### Spectrite Gem
An extremely rare mineral that can be acquired by mining Spectrite Ore.

Crafting Recipe (x9): Spectrite Block x1

### Diamond Rod

### Spectrite Brick
A brick made of Spectrite. What can you do with it? Make a block of Spectrite Bricks for building. Is this practical? By no means whatsoever.

### Spectrite Shovel
An extremely efficient shovel made of Spectrite with a diamond handle. When used on a shovel-effective block, a cross of surrounding weaker or equivalent blocks will also be destroyed, resulting in a maximum of 5 blocks destroyed per use. The surrounding blocks that will be destroyed depend on the player's rotation and perspective. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for destroying 5 shovel-effective blocks and only one block will be destroyed if the shovel is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

When used on a shovel-effective block, a square of surrounding weaker or equivalent blocks will also be destroyed, resulting in a maximum of 9 blocks destroyed per use. The surrounding blocks that will be destroyed depend on the player's rotation and perspective. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for destroying 9 shovel-effective blocks and only one block will be destroyed if the shovel is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end.

### Perfect Spectrite Sword
A ridiculously powerful sword made entirely of Spectrite. This sword creates a small explosion when used on an entity and inflicts a stronger and wider spread Spectrite Damage effect than the diamond handle version. Neither allies nor blocks are affected by this explosion. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with Spectrite Damage and no Spectrite Damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end. The Spectrite Damage effect will deal high damage to non-Spectrite shields.

### Spectrite Legend Blade
A special sword made entirely of Spectrite that is capable of even higher and more widely spread damage than a Perfect Spectrite Sword. This sword cannot be crafted and can only be obtained by defeating a Spectrite mob that uses this sword. There is a cooldown period (default 1.75s) for hitting an entity with Spectrite Damage and no Spectrite Damage will be applied if the sword is used before this cooldown has finished, though the item will be damaged just as much either way so it is more efficient just to wait for the cooldown to end. The Spectrite Damage effect will deal heavy damage to non-Spectrite shields.

Superchromaticity Effect: Spectrite Damage level increases from III to IV

### Spectrite Arrow
An arrow made of Spectrite. On collision, they explode with a similar Spectrite Damage effect to a Perfect Spectrite Sword, or a Spectrite Legend Sword effect for critical arrows. This effect can also be configured to be replaced with an ordinary explosion (damages terrain and self/allies), or to keep the Spectrite Damage effect while also adding an explosion. These arrows are extremely expensive to craft, therefore it is recommended they only be used with Spectrite bows with the infinity enchantment. These arrows can be fired from an ordinary bow, but they will do heavy damage to it and a fully repaired bow without unbreaking will be destroyed after just 4 Spectrite Arrows. Spectrite Bows are able to fire these arrows while taking significantly less damage.

### Spectrite Armour (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots)
A set of armour made of spectrite. It's just as protective as diamond but lasts a lot longer. In addition, the player's max health is increased with every piece with more health given for pieces that require more Spectrite Gems to craft. The total max health increase is 10 hearts by default but, depending on the value of the 'Spectrite Armour Bonus Mode' configuration option, the increase could be up to 50 hearts, though this setting is not recommended.

Superchromaticity Effect: Health increase is doubled
Set Bonus: Passive Regeneration I
Superchromaticity Set Bonus: Passive Spectrite Resistance I

### Spectrite Healing Orb
A prismatic orb filled with healing power that, when used with a right click, will give you 15 seconds of regeneration with a 30 second cooldown (15 seconds between regeneration). If used with full Spectrite Armour, it will enhance your already present regeneration effect. This cannot be crafted and can only be acquired by defeating a Spectrite Boss mob that is holding this orb.

Superchromaticity Effect: Increase regeneration effect time to 30s

### Potion of Spectrite Resistance
A potion that provides a temporary Spectrite Resistance effect. There is currently no way to obtain any of these in survival.

There are 3 variants for each of the 3 potion types: Spectrite Resistance I (3:00), Spectrite Resistance I (8:00), Spectrite Resistance II (1:30)

### Potion of Spectrite Damage
A potion that inflicts a Spectrite Damage effect. There is currently no way to obtain any of these in survival.

There are 5 variants for each of the 3 potion types: Spectrite Damage I, Spectrite Damage II, Spectrite Damage III, Spectrite Damage IV, Spectrite Damage V

### Arrow of Spectrite Resistance

There are 3 variants: Spectrite Resistance I (0:22), Spectrite Resistance I (1:00), Spectrite Resistance II (0:11)

### Arrow of Spectrite Damage 
A tipped arrow that carries a Spectrite Damage effect. It has the same variants as the potions.

### Bucket of Molten Spectrite
A bucket of deadly Molten Spectrite. Its only practical use is as a last-resort weapon since it cannot be used as a fuel source since it would melt its container. What? You want to know how the bucket can hold it? Well that's obviously becau

## Enchantments

### Superchromaticity
An enchantment that only works on tools and weapons made entirely out of Spectrite. These items will always have a multicoloured name. The enchantment will have a different effect based on the type of item, but this effect is always be a significant enhancement. These compatible items can be enchanted either by a Spectrite Chest or by using an enchantment book found in a Spectrite Dungeon.

## Mobs

### Spectrite Skeleton
A skeleton made of Spectrite. It carries either a Spectrite Bow or Perfect Spectrite Bow and fires Spectrite Arrows. Upon being defeated, it has a small chance to drop between 1 and 4 Spectrite Arrows and its armour and weapon each have a very small chance of dropping.

### Spectrite Wither Skeleton
A wither skeleton made of Spectrite. It carries a Spectrite Sword, a Perfect Spectrite Sword or, on a very rare occasion, a Spectrite Legend Blade. Upon being defeated, its armour and weapon each have a very small chance of dropping.

### Spectrite Creeper
A creeper made of Spectrite. Their explosion carries a powerful Spectrite Damage effect that leaves behind a lingering cloud of Spectrite Damage. Though they do not have any unique drops, their Spectrite Damage cloud can be used to create Arrows of Spectrite Damage.

### Spectrite Golem
A golem made of Spectrite that lives in Spectrite Dungeons. They are usually quite peaceful, though they do not like to be pushed around. They have extremely high endurance and power, but are somewhat lacking when it comes to speed. They will naturally heal over time.

Spectrite Golems have unique drops: Spectrite Brick (common), Spectrite Gem (uncommon), Spectrite Shield (very rare), Perfect Spectrite Shield (extremely rare)

Friendly Spectrite Golems can also be summoned by the player using the same pattern as the Iron Golem, but with Spectrite Blocks instead of Iron Blocks.

## Spectrite Bosses
On rare occassions, a Spectrite Skeleton or Spectrite Wither Skeleton, marked with a hue-rotating crown icon above its head, may spawn with full Spectrite Armour. Spectrite Skeletons will also be guaranteed a Perfect Spectrite Bow, while Spectrite Wither Skeletons will have a guaranteed Spectrite Legend Blade along with a Spectrite Healing Orb, which will boost its rate of healing. Depending on the difficulty mode, the mob's armour and/or weapon may also be enchanted with Superchromaticity. These bosses can be very hard to kill due to their high rate of healing and high damage, so it is recommended to avoid them until you have a Perfect Spectrite Sword (at the very least) along with full Spectrite Armour.

## Known Bugs

* The name of the Spectrite Legend Sword and Perfect Spectrite Legend Sword cannot be changed; this is because the text formatting in the default name would cause of mess of formatting characters translated into text, so this is an intential bug added to prevent a worse bug
* Changing dimensions with a Spectrite Armour max health boost may not appear to carry over into other dimensions and may cause buggy behaviour when taking damage (this is a Vanilla bug)
* Due to Potion Effects being sorted by Potion liquid color, the Spectrite Resistance passive effect will frequently change positions in the GUI (I have submitted a pull request to Forge that fixes this, but it has yet to be merged)
* Double Spectrite Chests have a buggy block breaking texture and, on one side, will disappear from view at a certain angle due to something along the lines of the double chest assuming the single chest's bounds
